#Research Qustions:

1.	What does descriptive statistics of the selected variables look like?(With certain graphs to describe)
2.	Which department has the highest attrition rate?
3.	Whatâ€™s the relationship between HourlyRate and MonthlyIncome ?
4.	Could we predict on the JobSatisfaction based on EnvironmentSatisfaction, MonthlyIncome, WorkLifeBalance and their interaction on it?
5.	Can we build up a decision tree that helps predict Attrition in IBM?

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
