This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

```

```{r}
df<-read.csv("BMHR.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE,encoding = "utf-8")
colname<-names(df)
colname[1]<-"Age"
names(df)<-colname
describe(df)
str(df)
```
```{r}
nrow(df)*0.75
sample_size<-sample(nrow(df),nrow(df)*0.75)

#set up training and 
training<-df[sample_size,]
testing<-df[-sample_size,]
pre_prune<-rpart.control(maxdepth = 30,cp=0)
model<-rpart(Attrition~.,training,method="class",control = pre_prune)



#post_pruning to get a more accurate model
plotcp(model)
post_prune<-prune(model,cp=0.013)

#draw a plot of 
rpart.plot(post_prune)
printcp(post_prune)


# test the model accuracy
testing$pre<-predict(post_prune,testing,"class")
mean(testing$pre==testing$Attrition)




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
